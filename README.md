# Car_Animated
I have animated a moving car on a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have written the code separately one in HTML, another in CSS and another in JavaScript.
All the code is linked to the HTML page.
you can download all the files and run the code, an animated car with beautiful background will be opened
on a website. Enjoy the animation.
